## Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: April 11, 2025_

At AC Wilson, I am committed to transparency and user empowerment, which extends to how I handle your personal information. This privacy policy outlines my approach to data collection and protection.

### Information Collection

#### Information You Provide

When you contact me through the website form, email, or other channels, I collect:

- Your name and email address
- Any information you choose to share about your project or inquiry

#### Information Collected Automatically

When you visit my website, certain non-personally identifiable information may be collected automatically, including:

- IP address (anonymized)
- Browser type and version
- Operating system
- Referring website
- Pages visited and time spent

I use privacy-respecting analytics that anonymize data and respect Do Not Track settings. This information helps me improve website performance and user experience without compromising privacy.

### Use of Information

I use the information collected to:

- Respond to your inquiries

### Data Protection

As a professional committed to open systems and transparency, I take several measures to protect your data:

- **Minimal Collection**: I only collect information necessary for providing services
- **Secure Storage**: All personal information is stored securely with appropriate safeguards
- **Limited Retention**: I keep personal information only as long as needed for the purpose collected
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: I do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties
- **Transparent Practices**: Changes to how I handle data will be clearly communicated

### Third-Party Services

This website uses a limited number of third-party services:

- Hosting provider (for website hosting)
- Email service provider (for communication)
- Analytics (privacy-focused, with data anonymization)

Each third-party service used is selected with privacy considerations in mind and configured to maximize data protection.
