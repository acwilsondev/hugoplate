## Who I Am

AC Wilson is a Denver-based freelance engineer who prioritizes openness, experimentation, and practical innovation. Through mission-critical web services, CI/CD, managed services, and ML/AI, I aim to break down barriers and create sustainable, user-centric systems.

I combine a hands-on, experimental mindset with a commitment to open systems and collaboration, delivering robust, scalable solutions that empower clients and end-users—without the drag of excessive bureaucracy.

## Core Values

My work and approach are guided by these fundamental principles:

1. **Encourage Open Systems**  
   I favor transparency, collaboration, open-source standards, and user freedom. You won't find me engaging in projects that promote excessive secrecy or vendor lock-in.

2. **Enable Others**  
   Every solution I design emphasizes reusability and extensibility. I believe in comprehensive documentation and knowledge sharing rather than dependency-based business models.

3. **Challenge Bureaucracy**  
   I question centralized control, reduce gatekeeping, and streamline workflows. I won't accept work that imposes unnecessary constraints on users.

4. **Engineer for Empowerment**  
   Usability, accessibility, and inclusivity are priorities in everything I build. I minimize barriers and avoid technology that deliberately excludes or marginalizes users.

5. **Tinker First, Ask Later**  
   I embrace curiosity, experimentation, and hands-on learning. My approach avoids overplanning to the point of stifling exploration and innovation.

## Professional Focus

My expertise centers on four key areas:

- **Mission-Critical Web Services**: Reliable, scalable web solutions designed for performance and resilience
- **CI/CD**: Streamlined development and deployment workflows that enhance productivity
- **Managed Services**: Comprehensive system management and maintenance for optimal performance
- **ML/AI Integrations**: Responsible and ethical AI implementations that solve real problems

## My Approach

My brand personality and work approach are characterized by:

- **Transparent & Approachable**: I maintain open communication and invite collaboration at every step.
- **Empowering**: My focus remains on user autonomy and sharing knowledge rather than creating dependencies.
- **Experimental & Resourceful**: I prefer hands-on learning and innovative solutions to theoretical approaches.
- **Principled**: I stand firm on openness, inclusivity, and minimal bureaucracy in all my work.

## Vision

I'm building toward a future where open systems and accessible technologies drive innovation and empower all users—eliminating barriers and amplifying creative solutions across industries.

Whether you're a tech startup looking for transparent, ethical engineering, a small to mid-sized business seeking collaborative solutions, or a larger organization aiming to adopt open practices, my approach centers on creating technology that truly enables and empowers.

Let's work together to build solutions that respect users, foster openness, and create lasting value.
