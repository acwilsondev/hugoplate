The website is functional with core content and configuration in place:

2. ✅ Site configuration completed (theme, menus, settings)
3. ✅ Brand colors and typography implemented (Dark Teal, Golden Yellow, etc.)
4. ✅ Visual assets requirements fully documented (both final and temporary)

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Create temporary visual assets** (1-2 days)
   - Use placeholder-assets-specs.md as a guide
   - Focus on logo, favicon, and service icons first
   - Tools needed: Figma, Canva, or similar design tool
   - Follow exact specifications for colors and dimensions

2. **Implement form handling** (1 day)
   - [~] Basic form setup complete with placeholder endpoint
   - [x] Added success message and form guidance
   - **EXTERNAL ACTION NEEDED**: Create Formspree.io account and update with actual form ID
   - Test submission process after account creation

3. **Set up build process** (1-2 days)

   - Implement automated deployment

### Design Dependencies

Two design specification documents have been created:

1. `visual-assets-request.md` - Comprehensive specifications for final professional assets
2. `placeholder-assets-specs.md` - Simplified specifications for temporary assets

The temporary assets should be created first to ensure site functionality, while the comprehensive specifications should be provided to a professional designer for the final assets.

The site is ready for initial review with the current content and configuration. All pages use the official brand color palette with Dark Teal (#00332e) as primary, Golden Yellow (#f2a900) as accent, and Montserrat and Open Sans fonts.
