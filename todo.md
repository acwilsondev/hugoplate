### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Create temporary visual assets** (1-2 days)

   - Focus on logo, favicon, and service icons first
   - Tools needed: Figma, Canva, or similar design tool
   - Follow exact specifications for colors and dimensions

2. **Implement form handling** (1 day)
   - [~] Basic form setup complete with placeholder endpoint
   - [x] Added success message and form guidance
   - **EXTERNAL ACTION NEEDED**: Create Formspree.io account and update with actual form ID
   - Test submission process after account creation

3. **Set up build process** (1-2 days)
   - Configure for optimal performance
   - Implement automated deployment

### Design Dependencies

Two design specification documents have been created:

1. `visual-assets-request.md` - Comprehensive specifications for final professional assets
2. `placeholder-assets-specs.md` - Simplified specifications for temporary assets

The temporary assets should be created first to ensure site functionality, while the comprehensive specifications should be provided to a professional designer for the final assets.

The site is ready for initial review with the current content and configuration. All pages use the official brand color palette with Dark Teal (#00332e) as primary, Golden Yellow (#f2a900) as accent, and Montserrat and Open Sans fonts.

### Asset Generation Commands

The following ImageMagick commands were used to generate placeholder gradient assets:

```bash
# Banner image - Dark Teal to lighter teal gradient
convert -size 800x600 gradient:"#00332e-#0d4f4a" assets/images/banner.png

# Call-to-action image - Diagonal gradient using brand colors
magick -size 800x400 gradient:"#00332e-#f2a900" -rotate 45 assets/images/call-to-action.png

# Service icons - Horizontal gradients using brand color combinations
magick -size 400x300 gradient:"#00332e-#8f6b18" assets/images/service-1.png
magick -size 400x300 gradient:"#897c1a-#f2a900" assets/images/service-2.png
magick -size 400x300 gradient:"#8f6b18-#00332e" assets/images/service-3.png
```

These commands can be modified to generate other gradient assets as needed.
